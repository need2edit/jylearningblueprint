# Learning Something Every Day

My daily log of what I have learned.

## Timeline

## May 2022

#### May 5, 2022
- Swift is type-safe AND memory-safe. Knew that already but putting it here.
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdRn4DJq9eY) Comparing Float values in Swift is hard. Ensuring things are actually equal with properties like [.ulpOfOne](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double/2995415-ulpofone) is a mind bender. Also math is still hard.

#### May 4, 2022
- [Mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) is a great way to build charts using markdown. It also has native support on Github! I wish it was part of DocC.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```

- DocC can be [hosted on github pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KoIXbm0nv4). This is what inspired this project.

### April 2022

- Xcode 13.3 introduced DocC support for App Targets. You are no longer limited to building docs from only Swift Packages.
