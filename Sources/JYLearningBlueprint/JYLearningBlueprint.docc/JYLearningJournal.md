# ``JYLearningBlueprint``

A collection of everything I've learned as an iOS Developer.

## Overview

I try to improve my skills each day. I do a few things:

- Set goals for what I want to learn at the beginning of the week.
- Watch a Video or work on a tutorial each morning.
- Schedule dedicated time per week to explore or learn something new.
- Attempt to summarize what I've learned at the end of the week.
