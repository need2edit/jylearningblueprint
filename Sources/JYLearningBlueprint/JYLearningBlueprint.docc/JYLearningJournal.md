# ``JYLearningBlueprint``

A collection of everything I've learned as an iOS Developer.

## Overview

I try to improve my skills each day. I do a few things:

- Set goals for what I want to learn at the beginning of the week.
- Video or tutorial each morning.
- Dedicated time per week to explore or learn something new.
- Attempt to summarize what I've learned at the end of the week.

## Projects

I'll link to each of the projects below as I build this out.

- App Clones
    - Settings App
    - App Store
    - Apple Store App
    - HBO
    - Netflix
