# Learning as a Habit

I think consistency and momentum are the most important things to building expertise. Many people I've worked with are good at what they do because they practice a lot.

Doing things on a regular basis builds momentum. Accumulating these small wins builds confidence. If you become more confident in solving a ton of small problems, the big ones won't seem so scary.

## Strategies

1. Make it a habit. Even if its a few minutes every morning, I always make sure to look up or watch something.
2. Add variety. Learning how someone solved a problem in another space can lead to new insights and questions.
3. Teach others. To teach someone else forces you to understand issues at a deeper level.
4. Find a mentor. Find someone you trust and follow their advice. It is easier to learn when someone else has already made the mistakes.
5. Narrow your scope. If I want to learn something big, I'll try to break it up first and tackle its smaller componets. You need to start somewhere. If someone gave me a complicated screen to build, I'll start the things I know how to build and go from there.
6. Make as many mistakes as possible as often as possible. I am confident in my abilities because I've experienced when things go horribly wrong. It has taken a long time, but knowing what doens't work can be more valuable than knowing what works.
